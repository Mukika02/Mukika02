Hi, Iâ€™m Lili ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been working at Whizystems Kft. since February 2024, and Iâ€™ve been involved in software development for almost 3 years. 

I have experience with:
- AI solutions (AutoGen, AGNO agent systems, automations)
- Python development
- as well as building SaaS applications (Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript, Payload)

but Iâ€™m always eager to learn any technology stack that helps me grow.

What truly motivates me is creating and solving problems in a way that delivers real value â€” I love when code is not only functional but meaningful. ðŸš€
